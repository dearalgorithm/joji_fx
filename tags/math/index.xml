This was my last exam, which I had to take it several times before reaching the ace!
With my new acquired knowledge, letâ€™s try to code a canvas animation which will show the relationship between the unit circle and a the graph of a sinusoidal function.
I would like to do something like this:

I have been thinking about abstraction and I would like to share my thoughts with you. Letâ€™s first of all define what I understand about abstraction, in computer science terms.
First definition:
An abstract definition of something is something that is as undefined as possible but can potentially be infinitely defined.
A less abstract version of First definition:
An abstract definition of something (x|object) is something (x|object) that is as undefined as possible (according to the current base knowledge) but can potentially be infinitely defined.</description></item></channel></rss>
