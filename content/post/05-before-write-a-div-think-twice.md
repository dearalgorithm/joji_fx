## Main entry content

Before writing a div, you might think twice, or even better, about one hundred times! Is there an HTML element whose definition fits the purpose of your div? If so, use it. This way, you are generating a positive impact for millions! Otherwise, the effect you are developing is harmful to millions.

At the end of this entry, I will provide several links of interest that you might use to code and deliver better HTML code. Inclusive and accessible for everyone. Or at least, you might try it. 

Let me do a short data break:

There are about 1 billion people with disabilities (15% of the world's population), and there are more than one hundred semantic HTML elements. Still, it is tough to find even one single website that uses semantic HTML as it should be done.

<img style="margin:0; max-height:100vh" src="/joji_fx/images/post05/semantic-html-and-wrong-html-example.jpeg" alt="Two websites, the first one uses semantic HTML, and the second one does not.">

Writing semantic HTML is not only a matter of accessibility but of doing things right. For years, dozens of volunteers had been writing the HTML specification; unfortunately, for years, I have been hearing “HTML is straightforward, it is not even a language!”. Well, if only 1% of the people saying this statement wrote proper HTML, today we would be living in a better world.

So why are we coding something wrong that is apparently easy? A possible answer could be that the user agents developers (browsers) allow it. I don't know if HTML is facile, but it is generally hard to find a language you can use just wrong. Another possible answer could be that HTML is not taught the right way. At least in college, when I was taught HTML, no one told me anything about semantics, ARIA, or accessibility. Definitely, a change in these two matters would have a significant impact in the world and on the (world wide web).

But there is something that I can do, and you can do, as an HTML writer, and it is written semantic HTML. You said over and over that HTML is easy! So there are no excuses. Just use it properly! 

I will end the entry here. Another day we will talk about ARIA. Until then, you might remember this:

<blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">
“If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.”
</blockquote>
