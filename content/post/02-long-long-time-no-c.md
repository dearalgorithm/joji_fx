Well, hi! How are you human/computer? I really hope there are no under voltage warnings in your log. What have I been doing all this time? Well, mainly, I've been chewing gum and making pretty bubbles with it (ending up smashing my whole face) and contemplating this mad world with my hands in my pockets.

Okay, I was kidding! Actually the most remarkable thing that I achieved last months it’s (drumroll…) I learnt React! Haha. Well, a little bit more than React. Today, new web apps are completely different, but in brief, there are a lot less TCP connections between the end system and the host. Mainly because with React (and derivatives) you serve a single file with the whole app. React has its own server, and its own DOM, and you interact with it rather than with the DOM Tree. I think React changed a lot since its start, and now looks like a much more solid technology to use in your projects. The fact that you can use a single framework for every single device (in terms of frontend code) it’s quite tempting. Also React, like the whole javascript ecosystem, takes advantages from node and the huge npm packets base benefits. So, yes, things have changed a lot since my first HTML Button coded with jQuery like 8/9 years ago (when I was not even a Developer!). The only thing that I feel that we did take a step back, is in terms of accessibility. I think that most new Developers even know about it. They could even think that accessibility means that you have a toggle dark mode option in your nav. Years ago, it was common to see lots of websites with the highest accessibility level: AAA, or at least: AA. I guess business it’s business but common, CS boys and girls, we can not allow that! And to finish this React matter that I just brought up, I want to quote the teacup story from Zen culture. Your teacup is full, empty your cup. That is the toughest part of any learning. React it’s not difficult by itself at all, but relearn it is, and I had to relearn my way to code web apps so I am quite happy with the result and with the fact that I was able to Relearn! That is for me the most important skill that I prove to myself.  

Also, [...opening CS section] [section loaded] [printing section…] I am learning a lot about networks, currently reading: (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition). A book that I have to read (some parts) as a theory of my network’s lesson (CS). In fact, I think that just reading this book, and doing the activities from it, should be the whole point of this semester. Such a fantastic book! Unfortunately, I feel that the activities that I am doing with this subject are not as good as the book activities. Anyways, I am having fun with networks. Love it! With OS I am doing good, but let's see my performance when I have to create trees with forks within nested loops. I will need a true JEDI that explains to me (a PADAWAN) how this should be done. About AI, well so far so good, but I can’t stop thinking about my bad semester with Graphs and Complexity (the previous subject) and the fact that this semester I was not able to pick Data Structures. This is a handicap because AI assumes that you master both things. I would like to study Graphs and Complexity again. I have no idea how I was able to pass exams when I was in a really bad health condition. I guess that we will always have OSSU, right?

Time for my cat to meow and for me to feed him. I will try to increase the writing frequency, but I won’t promise anything. Hope you understand. Dear human/robot, I have lots of things to do! I’ve to set up several ecommerces. I have to learn C. I have to get a job. I have to increase my math skills. I have to set up my new server (my RPi is near to reach its EOL). I have to try on AWS if paying for my new server was a mistake. And last but not least, I’ve lots of delicious gums to chew. Meanwhile, take care.

Jordi.
