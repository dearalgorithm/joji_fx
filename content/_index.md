Hi, I'm Joji (he/him). I am a Computer Science (mention in Computation) student. I like to spend my time learning about computers, math, and psychics. I have been a Developer for startups and large companies for the past few years. In this blog, I document experiments, thoughts, and Computer Science related stuff.
