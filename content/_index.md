Hi, I'm Joji (he/him). I like computers and I like having lots of fun. Thus, I spend time having lots of fun with computers. Sounds logic, right?
So in this blog, I'll be having lots of fun documenting experiments related with Computer Science. I’ll be following the [RDFM and STFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) standards as well as [The Tao of Programming](https://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html) guidelines. Please, don’t take the following lines too seriously 🐱‍💻
